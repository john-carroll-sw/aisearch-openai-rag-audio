Hey what's up

We would like to order some drinks but we haven't decided yet, would you like to recommend some?

The weather is really cool outside

I would like that.

My friend does not want coffee, could you recommend something other than coffee.

Apple Juice sounds good.

Also, I have another friend, he is really hangry.

Great, one of the two.

We want the sandwich.

How much is the price?

That's all thank you very much.
